### OWLCMS Wireless Referee Decision Box

This is work in progress firmware for wireless referee decision boxes for use with [OWLCMS](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4). 
It is currently built with the latest 3.1.0 release of Zephyr RTOS and targets an ESP32 platform. 
The intention of this device is to integrate into the MQTT refereeing feature of OWLCMS and serve as a wireless and application-specific refereeing device. The current hardware is in a prototype state but eventually this repository will link/refer to released hardware designs.
